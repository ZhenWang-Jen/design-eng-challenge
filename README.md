# Scout Design Engineer Assessment: Interactive Search Interface

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Overview

I've implemented a modern, engaging product search interface that balances information density with user experience through two distinct viewing modes:

### Dual-Mode Interface
1. **Meet Your Match (Swipe & Discover)**
   - Dating-app inspired interface showing one product at a time
   - Swipe/like/skip actions for quick decision making
   - 3D flip animation for detailed product information
   - Progress indicator showing remaining matches
   - Perfect for focused browsing and quick decisions

2. **See the Crowd (Show Me Everything)**
   - Traditional grid layout showing multiple products
   - Consistent save/flip actions with Meet Your Match
   - Efficient for comparing multiple products
   - Ideal for broad exploration

### Key Features
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced input with instant results
- **Smart Filters**: Multi-select categories, tags, price range, and sorting
- **Active Filter Chips**: Quick removal of applied filters
- **Saved Products**: Persistent storage of liked items
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion-powered transitions and micro-interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes
- **CommandPalette**: Quick Search & Actions, a power-user feature inspired by tools like Spotlight (macOS) and VSCode's Command Palette

### Addressing Key Questions

#### 1. Information Visibility vs. Overwhelm
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is revealed in layers:
  - Basic info visible at first glance
  - Detailed info available on card flip
  - Full details accessible via "Read more"
- **View Mode Choice**: Users can switch between focused (Meet Your Match) and comprehensive (See the Crowd) modes
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear typography and spacing to guide attention
- **Active Filter Visibility**: Current filters are always visible but collapsible

#### 2. Minimizing User Actions
- **One-Click Actions**: Like/skip/save with single click or swipe
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for power users: Alt+L for like, Alt+S for skip, Alt+V for view toggle
- **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent initial sort and filter settings
- **Persistent State**: Remembers user preferences and saved items
- **Quick Toggle**: Easy switching between view modes

#### 3. Key Tradeoffs
- **Meet Your Match vs. See the Crowd**
  - Meet Your Match: More engaging but slower for bulk browsing
  - See the Crowd: Faster comparison but less immersive
  - Solution: Let users choose based on their needs

- **Filter Complexity vs. Speed**
  - Rich filtering options vs. quick access
  - Solution: Collapsible filter panel with active filter chips

- **Animation vs. Performance**
  - Smooth transitions vs. rendering speed
  - Solution: Optimized animations with proper cleanup

- **Information Density vs. Clarity**
  - Detailed product info vs. clean interface
  - Solution: Progressive disclosure through card flip
